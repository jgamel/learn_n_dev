        "Linear regression refers to a model that assumes a linear relationship between input variables and the target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "With a single input variable, this relationship is a line, and with higher dimensions, this relationship can be thought of as a hyperplane that connects the input variables to the target variable. The coefficients of the model are found via an optimization process that seeks to minimize the sum squared error between the predictions (yhat) and the expected target values (y).\n",
        "\n",
        "A problem with linear regression is that estimated coefficients of the model can become large, making the model sensitive to inputs and possibly unstable. This is particularly true for problems with few observations (samples) or less samples (n) than input predictors (p) or variables (so-called p >> n problems).\n",
        "\n",
        "One approach to address the stability of regression models is to change the loss function to include additional costs for a model that has large coefficients. Linear regression models that use these modified loss functions during training are referred to collectively as penalized linear regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "A popular penalty is to penalize a model based on the sum of the absolute coefficient values. This is called the L1 penalty. An L1 penalty minimizes the size of all coefficients and allows some coefficients to be minimized to the value zero, which removes the predictor from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "An L1 penalty minimizes the size of all coefficients and allows any coefficient to go to the value of zero, effectively removing input features from the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "This penalty can be added to the cost function for linear regression and is referred to as Least Absolute Shrinkage And Selection Operator regularization (LASSO), or more commonly, “Lasso” (with title case) for short.\n",
        "\n",
        "A hyperparameter is used called “lambda” that controls the weighting of the penalty to the loss function. A default value of 1.0 will give full weightings to the penalty; a value of 0 excludes the penalty. Very small values of lambda, such as 1e-3 or smaller, are common.\n",
