        "\n",
        "Coffee shops are generally a popular place to hangout. Starbucks, Colectivo, Anodyne, Stone Creek, etc. are some of the sought-after coffee shops in Milwaukee. It is not just the rejuvenating coffee that attracts customers, but the ambience draws people who want to read, work on their laptops, write, do some deep thinking, carry on conversation, or just relax. However, sometimes getting a cup of coffee can take a long wait. Coffee shops try to minimize the wait times so that customers leave satisfied.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we will simulate a simple coffee shop. The purpose of this simulation is to see how the number of cashiers and baristas affect the wait times of customers. We will use Python with some relevant libraries to model this simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a customer arrives they go to the cashier to place the order and make the payment. The cashier accepts payments through cash or cards. It generally takes 15 to 30 seconds to service a payment by cash and 10 to 20 seconds to service a payment by card. Once the payment is made the item is prepared by the barista. The items on order are: Regular Coffee (10-15), Latte (30-45), Mocha (30-45), Cold Brew (10-20), Frappe (50-70), and Espresso (20-35). The numbers in brackets indicate how many seconds it takes to prepare the item. When the item is ready the customer picks up the order."

        "There are two wait periods in the above process. The first is the queue at the cashier and the second is the queue at the barista. The wait times at both the queues depend on the number of cashiers and baristas at work. More the number of cashiers and baristas, shorter will be the wait time. However, economic factors would stipulate that the shop could employ only a certain number of staff. This balance between number of staff and customer wait times is important for customer satisfaction as well as business viability."

        "SimPy models execute in an environment. Models comprise of processes which correspond to active components like customers in a shop, aircrafts in an airport, vehicles in a parking lot, etc. Processes interact with each other and the environment through events using the yield mechanism. Processes get suspended when they yield an event and resume when the event occurs. One of the important event types is the timeout. Timeouts are triggered after a user-defined amount of time has passed. This allows the process to sleep or hold its state for the given time. Events make use of resources which correspond to check-out counters in a shop, runways in an airport, parking spots in a lot, etc. Resources may be finite or infinite.\n",
        "\n",
        "Processes request resources during an event and release them when they are done. If resources are not available when requested, the process joins a queue and waits for the next available resource. There are two other kinds of resources called level, and store. These are used when we want to keep track of quantities that are being consumed by processes during events. An example for level would be the total amount of gasoline in the gas station. Whenever vehicles fill gas, the level of gasoline decreases. This can be factored in a simulation. A store tracks the production and consumption of items of multiple types."
